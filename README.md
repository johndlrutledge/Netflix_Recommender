Options to get started:
1) Download the Netflix prize top dataset and run the preprocessing file included (which took us several hours on a subset of the data)
2) To run the RNN.ipynb, you can save yourself significant preprocessing time by downloading a pkl of the final dataset here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PfPfdR17KlxVxj9dIsCi__VWpIR6RQm5/view?usp=sharing
3) V2 of the model uses a dense network with no preprocessing, so simply downlaod the dataset and then run the notebook.
